					<h3 id="chicken">CHICKEN</h3>
					<p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
					Males and females have fleshy combs atop their heads and lobed wattles below their bills. These and other fleshy protuberances are collectively known as caruncles. Shiny, pointed feathers known as hackles adorn the neck, and more appear along the back and are known as saddles. These birds usually have high, arched tails. In some breeds, the tail can extend up to 12 inches or more in length. Males, known as roosters, typically exhibit bolder, brighter colors than their female counterparts.

					Chickens are very gregarious creatures, and they live together in flocks. Intelligent and curious by nature, they develop social hierarchies within their flocks. These hierarchies, known as pecking orders, determine access to food, mates, nesting sites, and other resources. They typically consist of one dominant male, a handful of subdominant males, and two or more females that are watched over closely by the dominant male.

					A higher ranking individual may strike out at lower-ranking individuals with their beaks in a pecking order, pecking to drive them away from resources like food. During confrontations, males may also pummel at one another with their wings or scratch each other with their claws.

					Chickens use various calls to communicate with each other. For instance, rooster crows are used as territorial signals to other roosters in the area; sometimes, they are prompted by sudden disturbances. After laying eggs, hens cluck. They also cluck to summon their chicks (the name for baby chickens) over to them. Chickens also warn each other of danger using distinct warning calls based on whether the danger is coming from overhead or by land.

					<h3 id="beef">BEEF</h3>
					<p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.
					The consumption of beef poses numerous threats to the natural environment. Of all agricultural products, beef requires some of the most land and water, and its production results in the greatest amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG),[18] air pollution, and water pollution.[19] A 2021 study added up GHG emissions from the entire lifecycle, including production, transportation, and consumption, and estimated that beef contributed about 4 billion tonnes (9%) of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in 2010.[20]: 728  Cattle populations graze around 26% of all land on Earth, not including the large agricultural fields that are used to grow cattle feed.[21][22] According to FAO, "Ranching-induced deforestation is one of the main causes of loss of some unique plant and animal species in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America as well as carbon release in the atmosphere."[23] Beef is also the primary driver of deforestation in the Amazon, with around 80% of all converted land being used to rear cattle.[24][25][26] 91% of Amazon land deforested since 1970 has been converted to cattle ranching.[21][27] 41% of global deforestation from 2005 to 2013 has been attributed to the expansion of beef production.[28] This is due to the higher ratio of net energy of gain to net energy of maintenance where metabolizable energy intake is higher.[29] It takes seven pounds of feed to produce a pound of beef (live weight), compared to more than three pounds for a pound of pork and less than two pounds for a pound of chicken.[30] However, assumptions about feed quality are implicit in such generalizations. For example, production of a pound of beef cattle live weight may require between 4 and 5 pounds of feed high in protein and metabolizable energy content, or more than 20 pounds of feed of much lower quality.[29] A simple exchange of beef to soy beans (a common feed source for cattle) in Americans' diets would, according to one estimate, result in meeting between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 greenhouse gas emission goals of the United States as pledged in 2009.[31][needs update] A 2021 CSIRO trial concluded that feeding cattle a 3% diet of the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis could reduce the methane component of their emissions by 80%.[32][33]

					Some scientists claim that the demand for beef is contributing to significant biodiversity loss as it is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon region, are being converted to agriculture for meat production.[34][35][36] The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services also concurs that the beef industry plays a significant role in biodiversity loss.[37][38] Around 25% to nearly 40% of global land surface is being used for livestock farming, which is mostly cattle.[37][39]
					<h3 id="sushi">SUSHI</h3>
					<p>sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere (see also sashimi).
					Nigirizushi (握り寿司, "hand-pressed sushi") consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi; toppings are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.[original research?]

					Gunkanmaki [ja] (軍艦巻, "warship roll") is a special type of nigirizushi: an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of nori wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of nori such as roe, nattō, oysters, uni (sea urchin roe), sweetcorn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. Gunkan-maki was invented at the Ginza Kyubey restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.[34][35]

					Temarizushi (手まり寿司, "ball sushi") is a style of sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.
